# Handwriting Recognition using TensorFlow Keras
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using TensorFlow and its high-level API, Keras. The goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The project provides a practical demonstration of how to create, train, and evaluate a deep learning model for image classification tasks.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. README.md: Contains an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

2. requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

3. train.py: Python script for training the handwritten digit recognition model using TensorFlow Keras.

4. evaluate.py: Python script for evaluating the trained model on test data.

5. model.py: Defines the architecture of the CNN model using TensorFlow Keras layers.

7. utils.py: Utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with data, model training, and evaluation.


## Training:

Modify hyperparameters in train.py such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate according to your requirements.
Execute train.py to start training the model. The trained model will be saved to a specified directory (models/ by default).
Evaluation:

After training, use evaluate.py to evaluate the model's performance on test data.
Visualization:

Use Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to visualize the training process, explore data, and analyze model predictions.
Dataset
The project uses the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for this project typically consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction, and then fully connected (dense) layers for classification. The final layer uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each digit class.
